# WeatherInfo MVVM
It is a very simple MVVM design pattern app to show weather conditions of three different locations and also user can see weather conditions for next week.

Environment:
1. XCODE: 12.2
2. iOS Target: 13.0
3. Swift 5

Features
1. Display the name of your city with its current temperature, weather condition,
highest/lowest temperature, as well as the weather forecast for the upcoming week. 

2. Switch to the following 3 cities by swiping the screen to left or right. Three main cities Sydney, Perth, and Hobart data.

3. Display weather information for the next 15 days within one view.

Please note
1. I used mock data for two cities and one is coming from live API. The bulk data we need to show are having paid APIs. So, I added  JSON files of two cities with live static data for next 15 days from 9 Feb 2021.
